Abstract:
This study investigates the impact of salinity levels, total dissolved solids (TDS), groundwater levels (GWL), and land use patterns in the coastal region of Kebumen Regency, employing a statistical approach. Coastal areas are often vulnerable to salinity variations, which can significantly affect the surrounding ecosystems and land utilization. The research aims to discern the correlation between TDS, salinity levels, GWL and land use practices in this specific region, employing statistical analysis as a means of quantifying and understanding these relationships. Total dissolved solids (TDS) represent the concentration of inorganic salts, minerals, and ions in water bodies and play a crucial role in the overall water quality of coastal areas. Salinity levels, on the other hand, directly affect TDS and are influenced by factors such as tidal patterns and freshwater input. Groundwater levels affect salinity and TDS. Land use practices, including agricultural, residential, and industrial activities, profoundly impact coastal ecosystems and are often influenced by salinity levels. This study utilizes statistical methods to analyze the complex interplay between TDS, salinity, GWL, and land use in the Kebumen Regency coastal region. By examining data related to TDS, salinity, GWL, and land utilization, this research seeks to contribute valuable insights into the sustainable management of coastal environments. The findings of this study are expected to inform decision-making processes for the benefit of local communities and ecosystems, guiding future policies and practices for the preservation and balanced development of coastal areas in Kebumen Regency
